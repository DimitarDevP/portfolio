            <p>
                I am currently working for a VR/AR company called Tradiebot Industries where I hold the position of a Junior Computer Vision
                Developer. During my employment in this comapny so far, I have mostly worked with OpenCV on both Python and C++. I have also
                worked with Android Studio, Arduino and I am currently working with the Godot Engine.

            <h3>Browser Automation</h3>
            <h4>Company: TBN</h4>
            <h4>Duratuon: October 2018 - July 2019</h4>
            <p>
                TBN was not an official company. It was a group of developers who had creative ideas and tried to bring those ideas to life 
                and generate passive income from the applications they collectively develop.
                The team I was on was was mainly focusing browser automation. My task was to develop a bot in Python using
                the Selenium framework. The team was disbanded in July of 2019 due to lack of motivation and resources among the members.
